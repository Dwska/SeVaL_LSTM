# SeVaL_LSTM
this is project for evaluating sentiments using lstm model. (it's a working project and still awful output)
- beside that it also use keras tuner with random search method to auto-tuning the hyperparameters.
- it uses Sigmoid function for multi-class classification because each label are independents.
- it uses binary cross entroply loss function because each labels has either two values which true or not.

The dataset is track A which uses english language from https://www.codabench.org/competitions/3863/
